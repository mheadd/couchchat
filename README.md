## CouchChat: A realtime chat server for CouchDB

This is a simple demo app that I use when talking about CouchDB. I'm actively developing it, but its currently in a very alpha state. More good stuff to come.

This project was inspired by the awesome [Toast](https://github.com/jchris/toast) project by jchris, but all the code is my own (so if there is anything funky, the blame is mine).

## Deploying this app

Assuming you just cloned this app from git, and you have changed into the app directory in your terminal, you want to push it to your CouchDB with the CouchApp command line tool, like this:

    couchapp push . http://name:password@hostname:5984/mydatabase

If you don't have a password on your CouchDB (admin party) you can do it like this (but it's a bad, idea, set a password):

    couchapp push . http://hostname:5984/mydatabase

If you get sick of typing the URL, you should setup a `.couchapprc` file in the root of your directory. Remember not to check this into version control as it will have passwords in it.

The `.couchapprc` file should have contents like this:

    {
      "env" : {
        "public" : {
          "db" : "http://name:pass@mycouch.couchone.com/mydatabase"
        },
        "default" : {
          "db" : "http://name:pass@localhost:5984/mydatabase"
        }
      }
    }

Now that you have the `.couchapprc` file set up, you can push your app to the CouchDB as simply as:

    couchapp push

This pushes to the `default` as specified. To push to the `public` you'd run:

    couchapp push public

Of course you can continue to add more deployment targets as you see fit, and give them whatever names you like.
